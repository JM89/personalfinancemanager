# EI_02 - ATM Withdraw Management

## Description

An ATM withdraw is a special expense that won’t be shown in the dashboard as it is not split by expense type. The cash expenses attached to it are the ones which needs to be displayed. As the amount can’t necessarily be precise for cash expenses and they might come later after the amount is removed from the account, we define this ATM withdraw object.

## Close ATM withdraw

Closing an ATM withdraw means that we won’t be able to take any cash expenses on it. It might not be zero as the cash expenses are not precise.
