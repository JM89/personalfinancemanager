# PFM - Authentication API

## Getting Started

### Debug the API

Open the solution and make sure you set PFM.Auth.Api as the start up project. 

There is currently no support for Swagger.

The application can be found [here](http://localhost/#/events?filter=Application%20%3D%20'PFM.Auth.Api').

### Test the API

{
	"username": "test",
	"password": "test"
}

}
```
